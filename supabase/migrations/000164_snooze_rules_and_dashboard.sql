-- Migration 000164: wire snoozes into the rules engine and dashboard view
--
-- Two changes:
--
--   1. proofs_needing_attention() — add a WHERE NOT EXISTS guard in the
--      final SELECT that excludes any (proof_id, rule_code) pair with an
--      active snooze. The body is otherwise identical to 000154.
--      dashboard_tile_counts() calls this function and therefore picks
--      up the exclusion automatically — no changes needed there.
--
--   2. public_dashboard_projects — drop + recreate (Postgres can't add
--      columns to an existing view) to add six snooze columns via a
--      lateral join: snooze_rule_code, snoozed_until, snooze_note,
--      snoozed_by_name, snoozed_by_initials, snoozed_by_colour.
--      The lateral returns the longest-remaining active snooze for the
--      proof so the dashboard Snoozed section and per-row indicators
--      have all the data they need in a single query.
