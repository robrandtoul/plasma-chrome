-- 000250_approved_no_order_rule.sql
--
-- Needs-attention rule: an APPROVED proof that has never had an order (pay)
-- link sent. Closes the approval -> order handoff gap. Once a proof is
-- approved it shows the green "Approved" pill and (after ~14 days) drops off
-- the dashboard working set, so an approved-but-never-invoiced proof becomes
-- LESS visible over time, not more. This rule keeps it on the dashboard with a
-- reason chip until a link is sent (or the proof leaves 'approved').
--
-- Ships DISABLED by default (enabled=false): with online ordering not yet the
-- norm, enabling it immediately would flag the whole back-catalogue of approved
-- proofs that were invoiced / paid offline. Turn it on from Admin ->
-- Needs-attention once online ordering is the norm; snooze any proof that is
-- legitimately handled another way.
--
-- Fires when: status='approved', approved_at set and >= threshold_days ago, and
-- the proof has NO order in status sent / paid / fulfilled (a 'sent' link is
-- already out -> the order-reminder job owns that chase; paid/fulfilled ->
-- done). draft / expired / cancelled orders do NOT count as "a link is out", so
-- those still fire.
--
-- Designer-side rule: NOT a customer-chase rule, so it is deliberately excluded
-- from the Help Scout reply-grace window and the follow-up suppression that gate
-- the chase rules. Snooze works automatically (the snooze guard in `filtered`
-- applies to every flagged rule).

-- 1) Seed the rule into the editable rules document. Idempotent: only adds the
--    key when missing, so a re-run (or a later hand-edited priority/threshold)
--    survives.

-- 2) Teach the rules engine the new rule. Body is the live definition verbatim,
--    plus: the rule_ano variable, the `ano` CTE, and the `approved_no_order`
--    branch in `flagged`. Nothing else changes.
